### How it works

- A Spawn requires _resources and _idealSize. It is IMPORTANT that those two values are carefully chosen depending on each other.
- If the idealSize is too high you will get a big party with only weak troops. If it is too low then all spawned troops will be max 

- Until HardMin is reached all Resource Costs are ignored. This will guarantee that a troop alwas has at least a reasonable minimum

- PlayerStrength can optionally influence when certain Units will appear or no longer appear (not used by me atm)
- If the spawned troops reach HardMax then no more troops can spawn. Unlike _idealSize which only makes that unlikely

_idealSize: int
    - Algorithm only starts upgrading troops once it has spawned troops up to _idealSize
_availableResources: int
    - Algorithm never spends more resources for their next buy than available. Only exception is to reach HardMin
_customHardMin: int
    - overwrites the HardMin given by the Party
_customHardMax: int
    - overwrites the HardMax given by the Party

- PartMin: float
    - states what percentage of the generated party should consist of this UnitBlocks
- PartMax: float
    - states what percentage of the generated party can at most be from this UnitBlocks
- ReqSize: int
    - this unitBlock will only start spawning if the generated party is at least ReqSize big




### Current Issues

- Barbarian Beastmaster with 4 unit types only rarely upgrade fully compared to the barbarian frontline with 3 unit types.
    - Given high resources the frontline always ends up being only Chosen while the beastmaster rarely get one to highest level
    - BeastMaster should be upgraded way earlier and more consistent alongside the rest of the group just like in vanilla
    - Mabye a new custom variable for UnitBlocks? e.g. UpgradeChance Bonus

- When giving custom PartMin and PartMax values then I currently overwrite the original values with those custom onces.
- And since I'm working on references here I tarnish the original data in case other spawns also use them.


### Discussion Points

- Should we use many parameter with default values or tables to instantiate our classes with? 

- I made a slight change to the weight for which UnitBlock to upgrade (not perfect)

- getAverageCost function for UnitBlocks and Parties. Other functions along that line can help generating a safety net to prevent horrible _idealSize - _resources ratios

- Why are Guards generated in reversed order?

- I splitted the main for-loop into three for-loops. At best that's a sidegrade

- Should we write clone() functions for our classes? That way we can easier grant ability to overwrite default parameters of existing data.
- Currently a Party allows to overwrite PartMin, PartMax and ReqSize of its UnitBlocks by wrapping those variables in an extra table container around those Blocks.
- This is rather ugly solution


### Improvements?

- Mabye we define a new spawn/upgrade behavior for certain UnitBlocks that can be toggled
- This would make their spawning and traversing through their tiers much more linear and predictable.
- It could "overcharge" weights that they give out about themselves when they realize that they are behind the curve
- And instead of randomly upgrading troops they upgrade the lowest troops always

- Introduce a second set of parameters similar to PartMin and PartMax but for spend resources.
- That way UnitBlocks will guarantee that they get some resource to invest in them every now and then even if they only consist of very few troops


- ADd handling for AI Behviours to this framework?
- It would be one of the possible next things to add support for once the basic dynamic spawn works.
- But currently: Low Priority
